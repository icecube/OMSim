 * @note In the following a short introduction of an effective area study is made with the mDOM as an example. For further details see Chapter 10 of <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/physik_kp/agkappes/abschlussarbeiten/doktorarbeiten/1702-phd_lclassen.pdf">Lew Classen's thesis</a> or

 * During the design of a module its sensitivity is optimised by considering the optical properties of various materials and altering the geometry and positioning of the mechanical components in the Geant4 simulation.
 * The metric to optimise the module's sensitivity is the effective area \f$A_{\mathrm{eff}}(\theta, \phi)\f$. This represents the area that is detected from a plane wave of incidence angle
 * of \f$\theta\f$ (zenith) and \f$\phi\f$ (azimuth) with respect to the module. This parameter is calculated with OMSim by simulating a disk emitting mono-energetic photons
 * perpendicular to its surface with a uniform density profile.
 * The photon generation is made with the module @link AngularScan @endlink, running the method @link AngularScan::runSingleAngularScan @endlink once for each direction to be investigated

 *  After simulating $N$ photons from a plane of area \f$A_{\mathrm{rad}}\f$ (which has to be larger than the projected area of the mDOM), the effective area is calculated as
 *    \f[
 *        A_{\mathrm{eff}}(\theta, \phi) = \frac{N_{\mathrm{det}}(\theta, \phi)}{N}\cdot A_{\mathrm{rad}},
 *    \f]
 *    where \f$N_{\mathrm{det}}\f$ is the number of photons detected by the module. To optimise the sensitivity over multiple directions, \f$A_{\mathrm{eff}}(\theta, \phi)\f$ is calculated
 *    for various angle pairs, and the mean effective area, \f$\overline{A}_{\mathrm{eff}}\f$, is determined. The \f$n\f$ angle pairs are chosen using healpix, which separates a
 *    sphere into \f$n\f$ pixels of equal area. Thus,
 *    \f[
 *        \overline{A}_{\mathrm{eff}} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n A_{\mathrm{eff}}(\theta_i, \phi_i).
 *   \f]
 *
 *    Since the effective area is wavelength dependent, the calculation must be repeated for different wavelengths. Wavelengths shorter than 300nm are absorbed by the pressure vessel,
 *  whereas the QE of the PMT approaches zero at wavelengths longer than 700nm.
 *
 * @subsection exampleEA Example using healpy
 *
 * In the following a toy example of the usage of the effective area module is given. Although there are c++ healpix libraries, in my opinion the easiest way of getting the angle pair
 * coordinates is using Healpy in python.
 *
 * In principle for short simulations you could run the program directly from python using the angles from healpy as input parameters:
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
 * import healpy as hp
 * import numpy as np
 * from os import system
 *
 * NSIDE = 8 #only powers of 2 allowed, the larger, the more pixels are calculated
 * NPIX = hp.nside2npix(NSIDE)
 * thetas, phis = np.degrees(hp.pix2ang(nside=NSIDE, ipix=np.arange(NPIX)))
 *
 * for i, (theta, phi) in enumerate(zip(thetas, phis)):
 *     if i==0:
 *         system(f"./OMSim_effective_area -n 10000 --environment 1 -r 300 -t {theta} -f  {phi} --output_file output")
 *     else:
 *         system(f"./OMSim_effective_area -n 10000 --environment 1 -r 300 -t {theta} -f  {phi} --output_file output --no_header")
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * However, this is <b>very</b> inefficient. The best is to save the angle pairs into a file and pass it as argument. If you give a file as argument, the arg theta and phi are ignored.
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
 * import healpy as hp
 * import numpy as np
 * from os import system
 *
 * NSIDE = 8 #only powers of 2 allowed, the larger, the more pixels are calculated
 * NPIX = hp.nside2npix(NSIDE)
 * thetas, phis = np.degrees(hp.pix2ang(nside=NSIDE, ipix=np.arange(NPIX)))
 * fname = "angle_pairs.txt"
 * np.savetxt(fname, np.column_stack((thetas, phis)))
 * system(f"./OMSim_effective_area -n 10000 --environment 1 -r 300 --angles_file {fname} --output_file output")
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * In my PC the first code block needs 51 seconds (tested with NSIDE=2) , the second block only 14 seconds (as simulation has to be initialised only once).
